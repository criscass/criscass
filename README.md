<h1>Cristian Cassetta</h1>
<h3>Frontend Web Developer</h3>



I'm Cristian, originally from Italy but currently living in the Netherlands.
Over the past four years, I've learned and practiced a variety of technologies, both old and new, 
including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and TypeScript), React, Svelte, Astro.js, SQL, Python, and Git. 
I've built several websites and apps and thoroughly enjoy designing and coding ideas, bringing them to life on the web.
